# Program 3
### Description
A COMP SCI 353 Assignment. This program is intended to use tagged data to model a bank's payment system at a very primitive level.

### How to use
1. Open the "Program-3.rkt" file in DrRacket
2. Click "Run" in the DrRacket IED located at the top right while still focused on the "Program-3.rkt" file
3. The file will be exported to the root file located within the Project Folder under "STATEMENT.TXT"

*Note: Should you wish to change the output of the file, abide by the documentation's formatting strictly else bugs will be highly prevalent throughout the program.
All other files regarding "Program-3.1 (test)" and "tests.rkt" are experimental/testing files used during the development phase and are not guaranteed to be operating at this time*
